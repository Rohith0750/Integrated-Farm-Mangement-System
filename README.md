## Project Overview

**PRJ_533** is a full-stack integrated software platform built to modernize agricultural management. It bridges the gap between raw agricultural data and day-to-day farm operations by bringing together farm administration, environmental monitoring, machine learning predictions, and rule-based decision support into a single control panel.

The system does not rely on physical hardware or direct IoT sensors. Instead, it leverages open agricultural datasets, curated soil/crop records, image-based plant disease repositories, and external weather APIs. By unifying these data streams, the system empowers farmers, farm managers, and agricultural advisors to transition from intuitive guessing to evidence-based agricultural planning.

---

## Problem Statement

Traditional agricultural practices face several operational inefficiencies and data-accessibility bottlenecks:

1. **Fragmented Farm Information**: Operational data regarding soil health, crop cycles, financial expenditures, inventory stocks, and worker allocation are typically recorded manually or split across incompatible tools.
2. **Inefficient Resource Utilization**: Over-irrigation, inaccurate fertilizer application, and mistimed pesticide deployment result in economic waste and land degradation.
3. **Absence of Predictive Insights**: Farmers lack accessible predictive tools to evaluate which crops are best suited for their specific soil chemistry or to forecast expected yields before planting.
4. **Weather Volatility and Risks**: Rapidly changing weather patterns often compromise rigid operational schedules, leading to damaged harvests when irrigation or fertilization coincides with heavy rainfall.
5. **Delayed Crop Disease Diagnosis**: Plant diseases often spread unchecked due to delayed visual identification and lack of immediate access to agricultural expertise.
6. **Financial and Supply Chain Blind Spots**: Inability to track input costs against yield revenues hinders accurate profitability calculations and long-term farm planning.

PRJ_533 addresses these challenges by consolidating administrative, analytical, and intelligent capabilities into a unified decision-support application.

---

## Project Objectives

- **Centralize Farm Data**: Provide a single repository for fields, crops, soil parameters, worker schedules, equipment inventory, and financial ledgers.
- **Provide Actionable Decision Support**: Synthesize machine learning predictions with environmental data and rule engines to generate practical recommendations rather than uncontextualized metrics.
- **Predict Optimal Crop and Yield Performance**: Utilize trained machine learning models to recommend suitable crops based on soil composition and predict expected harvest yields.
- **Enable Image-Based Disease Detection**: Implement computer vision models to identify crop diseases from uploaded leaf images and recommend mitigation strategies.
- **Optimize Resource Planning**: Reduce waste in water, fertilizer, labor, and capital through data-driven scheduling.
- **Track Farm Financial Performance**: Record operational income and expenses per harvest cycle to maintain complete financial transparency.

## System Architecture

The application follows a decoupled multi-tier architecture consisting of a React.js client interface, a Node.js/Express RESTful backend API, a MongoDB database, a dedicated Python FastAPI service for machine learning models, and external API integrations.

### Component Interaction Flow

1. **User Interaction**: The user interacts with the React frontend to view dashboards, record farm logs, request ML predictions, or upload leaf images.
2. **API Orchestration**: The Node.js/Express backend handles authentication, request routing, data validation, and database operations with MongoDB.
3. **Intelligence Ingestion**: When predictive operations are triggered, the Express backend sends structured feature vectors or media files to the Python FastAPI ML microservice.
4. **Model Execution**: The FastAPI service executes trained Python models (Scikit-Learn, XGBoost, PyTorch/YOLO) and returns prediction outputs to the Express backend.
5. **Decision Synthesis**: The backend passes raw predictions alongside real-time weather data, soil records, and rule sets into the Decision Support Engine.
6. **Response Delivery**: The synthesized, actionable recommendation is stored in MongoDB and rendered on the client dashboard.

## AI/ML Capabilities

The intelligence layer of PRJ_533 consists of four specialized machine learning modules and one unified decision-support engine.

### 1. Crop Recommendation Engine
- **Input Features**: Soil Nitrogen (N), Phosphorus (P), Potassium (K), pH level, ambient temperature, humidity, and annual rainfall.
- **Model Architecture**: Multi-class classification algorithms (Random Forest / Decision Trees / SVM) trained on agricultural soil-crop datasets.
- **Output**: Ranked list of suitable crops optimized for the specified soil composition and climate parameters.

### 2. Crop Yield Prediction Model
- **Input Features**: Selected crop type, field area (hectares), historical rainfall, soil chemical profile, average temperature, and irrigation frequency.
- **Model Architecture**: Gradient Boosted Trees (XGBoost) and Regression models calibrated on historical yield metrics.
- **Output**: Forecasted crop yield expressed in metric tons per hectare alongside estimated total harvest volume.

### 3. Fertilizer Recommendation Engine
- **Input Features**: Current soil NPK deficits, targeted crop nutrient requirements, field soil pH, and current crop growth stage.
- **Model Architecture**: Hybrid model combining rule-based nutritional tables with supervised learning classifiers.
- **Output**: Specific fertilizer recommendations (e.g., Urea, DAP, NPK formulations) with precise application dosage and timing.

### 4. Image-Based Crop Disease Detection
- **Input Features**: User-uploaded leaf imagery captured via camera or mobile upload.
- **Model Architecture**: Deep Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) / PyTorch / YOLO models fine-tuned on plant pathology image datasets (such as PlantVillage).
- **Output**: Identified disease classification, severity level, confidence percentage, and recommended treatment protocols.

### 5. Integrated Agricultural Decision-Support Engine
- **Functionality**: Raw ML output is rarely sufficient for direct farm action. The decision-support engine combines model predictions with real-time weather forecasts, soil status, and predefined agricultural logic to produce context-aware directives.

## Example Decision-Support Scenario

Consider a scenario where a farmer is cultivating tomatoes:

```text
[Input State]
• Crop: Tomato (Flowering Stage)
• Field Soil Status: Moisture level indicates low soil hydration (Requires Irrigation)
• System Trigger: Soil Moisture rule triggers "Irrigation Required" flag
• Weather Forecast API: 85% probability of heavy rainfall (45mm) within 12 hours
```

### Traditional vs. System Decision

- **Without Decision Support**: The farmer relies solely on soil dryness and initiates a full irrigation cycle. Within hours, heavy rainfall occurs, resulting in flooded soil, nutrient leaching, root asphyxiation, and wasted energy/water.
- **With PRJ_533 Decision Support**: The decision engine cross-references the soil moisture alert with the incoming precipitation forecast. The system evaluates the rule set:

```text
IF soil_moisture == LOW 
AND expected_precipitation_24h > 20mm 
THEN recommendation = "DELAY_IRRIGATION"
```

## Security Architecture

The platform incorporates basic security controls across application layers:

- **Authentication & Session Security**: Stateless authentication implemented via JSON Web Tokens (JWT) signed with secure secret keys and set with configurable expiration periods.
- **Password Protection**: Passwords are hashed before database storage using `bcrypt` salt rounds.
- **Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)**: Middleware handles authorization checks to restrict access to sensitive admin operations.
- **Input Validation & Sanitization**: Incoming request payloads are validated using middleware schema checking to prevent malicious inputs.
- **Environment Isolation**: Application secrets, API keys, and database connection strings are managed via isolated `.env` environment files.
- **CORS Policies**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) is configured on backend services to restrict unauthorized cross-domain API invocation.

---

## Testing Strategy

Quality assurance and model verification are conducted across individual application layers:

- **Backend API Testing**: Endpoint routing, authentication middleware, and data transformation logic are validated using Postman collection collections and HTTP request suites.
- **ML Model Evaluation**: Machine learning models are evaluated prior to serialization using standardized statistical metrics:
  - Classification models (Crop & Disease): Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score, Confusion Matrix.
  - Regression models (Yield): Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), Mean Absolute Error (MAE), R-squared ($R^2$) coefficient.
- **Frontend Verification**: UI component rendering, form validation state management, and API integration are manually and functionally verified across common client resolutions.

## System Limitations

1. **Dataset Dependency**: The accuracy of ML predictions is bounded by the representative quality, sample volume, and balance of the underlying training datasets.
2. **External API Reliance**: Weather monitoring functions depend on third-party API connectivity and service uptime.
3. **No Direct Hardware Control**: The system is designed purely as a decision-support platform; it does not directly actuate physical machinery or automated irrigation valves.
4. **Advisory Nature**: System outputs provide recommendations intended to support, rather than replace, qualified agricultural judgment and expert local domain knowledge.
